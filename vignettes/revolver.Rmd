The `REVOLVER` package implements the statistical model described in [Caravagna et al; PMID: 30171232](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171232) to determine trajectories of repeated evolution from multi-region sequencing data of human cancers. 

With `REVOLVER` you can follow a 4-steps pipeline:

1. generate phylogenetic trees for each patient in the cohort;

2. fit the best tree to a patient's data, accounting for its correlation with the other patients' trees;

3. cluster the cohort into groups of patients whose tumours are shaped by similar evolutionary pressures, and determine the confidence of these assessments using  jackknife statistics;

4. plot data, models, clusters, confidence etc.;

The correlation across trees is measured extracting evolutionary trajectories from the *phylogenetic ordering* of driver alterations annotated in the cohort These driver events shall occur across multiple patients; for this reason, `REVOLVER` is a method to determine evolutionary trajectories that *repeate* across patients, and that can be used to stratify yout cohort.

### Vignettes

The following vignettes are available:

1. [Introduction:](https://caravagn.github.io/revolver/articles/Input_formats.html) which discusses input formats, and the creation of  a `REVOLVER` cohort from input sequencing data;

2. [Getter functions:](https://caravagn.github.io/revolver/articles/Getters.html) which discusses different getter functions to extract information from a `REVOLVER` cohort;

3. [Plotting functions:](https://caravagn.github.io/revolver/articles/Plotting_functions.html) which discusses different plotting functions to visualize cohorts, data, fits etc.;
