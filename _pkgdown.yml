- title: Getters functions
  desc:  These functions can be used to extract data from a REVOLVER cohort object. These include the raw data used to create the cohort, driver information, clonal and subclonal events and the trees that are associated to the patients.

- title: Stats functions
  desc:  These functions can be used to extract either cohort-level statistics data from a REVOLVER cohort object, and other statistics that regard the computations performed on the cohort.

- title: Plotting functions
  desc:  These functions can be used to plot data, fits and clusters from a REVOLVER cohort object.

- title: S3 functions
  desc:  The two S3 classes of REVOLVER objects implement the following S3 mehtods. Class `rev_cohort` represents a basic cohort object before the fits, class `rev_cohort_fit` is a cohort object where fits are now available.
