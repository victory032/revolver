- title: Analysis functions
  desc:  These functions can be used to analyse a REVOLVER cohort.
  contents:
  - revolver_fit
  - revolver_cluster
  - revolver_jackknife
  
- title: Getters functions
  desc:  These functions can be used to extract data from a REVOLVER cohort object. These include the raw data used to create the cohort, driver information, clonal and subclonal events, the trees that are associated to the patients and other analysis results.

- title: S3 functions
  desc:  The two S3 classes of REVOLVER objects implement the following S3 mehtods. Class `rev_cohort` represents a basic cohort object before the fits, class `rev_cohort_fit` is a cohort object where fits are now available.
