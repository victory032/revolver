\title{Plot the number of observed trajectories in each cluster.}
\usage{
plot_trajectories_per_cluster(x, min_counts = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A revolver object with clusters computed.}

\item{min_counts}{A scalare >= 1 to subset only trajectories observed
in \code{min_counts} patients. If the value is in (0,1), the cut is
interpreted as a percentage and used to determine its actual value from
the cluster size (e.g., \code{n * min_counts}).}
}
\value{
A figure with multiple plots.
}
\description{
Assemble a figure that plots a graph (or tree) per
cluster where each driver is connected to its trajectories. This
allows to determine the most frequent trajectories in a cluster.

\examples{
# Data released in the 'evoverse.datasets'
data('TRACERx_NEJM_2017_REVOLVER', package = 'evoverse.datasets')

# In at least 5 cases
plot_trajectories_per_cluster(TRACERx_NEJM_2017_REVOLVER, min_counts = 5)

# In 50\% of the cluster's cases
plot_trajectories_per_cluster(TRACERx_NEJM_2017_REVOLVER, min_counts = .5)
