\title{Fit a REVOLVER model.}
\usage{
revolver_fit(x, initial.solution = 1, max.iterations = 10, n = 10,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A REVOLVER cohort where trees per patient have been already computed.}

\item{initial.solution}{Either a scalar to fix one initial condition 
(rank id), or \code{NA} to sample it randomly across all possivle solutions.
Notice that if the inital conditin is fixed the other parameter `n` should be 1.}

\item{max.iterations}{Maximum number of EM steps before forcing stop.}

\item{n}{Number of initial conditions sampled to compute optimal fit.}

\item{...}{Other paraemters, not used.}
}
\value{
A new object of class \code{"rev_cohort_fit"} which represents a
REVOLVER cohort object with fits.
}
\description{
Fit a REVOLVER model.
}
\details{
The main fitting function for REVOLVER, implements the 2-steps algorithm described
in the REVOLVER paper (Caravagna et al., Nature Methods volume 15, pages 707â€“714, 2018;
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0108-x). The output object contains a new field
`$fit` which contains the fit results.
}
\examples{
data(CRC.cohort)
fit = revolver_fit(CRC.cohort)
}
