\usage{
revolver_cluster(
  x,
  patients = x$patients,
  hc.method = "ward",
  split.method = "cutreeHybrid",
  min.group.size = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{"rev_cohort_fit"} object for which the evolutionary distance has been computed.}

\item{hc.method}{Method for hierarchial clustering, anything that can be
passed to the \code{agnes} function of the \code{cluster} package.}

\item{split.method}{Method to cut the dendrogram, anything of 
\code{cutreeDynamic}, \code{cutreeDynamicTree} or \code{cutreeHybrid} which are
available in the \code{dynamicTreeCut} package, or \code{static} to use the
\code{find_k} function from the \code{dendextend} package.}

\item{min.group.size}{Minimum group size for \code{dynamicTreeCut} functions.}
}
\value{
The input \code{x} with a modified field \code{cluster} that
stores all relevant clustering results.
}
\description{
Compute hierarchical clustering for a REVOLVER cohort with fit models.
To compute clusters first a pairwise distance is computed between
the patients, then the \code{cluster} package is used to compute a 
dendrogram of the patients, and is split using the heuristic dendrogram-cutting
functions available in the \code{dynamicTreeCut} package. This function accepts
parameters that are forwarded to the functions to carry out this task.

Results are stored inside the field \code{cluster} of the returned object.
